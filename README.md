# A* Pathfinding Visualization

## Description
This project implements an A* search algorithm to find optimal paths in a simulated environment, featuring a graphical visualization of a robot's movement along its path. The algorithm is designed to navigate through a grid while avoiding obstacles, making it suitable for applications in robotics and automated exploration.

## Features
- A* pathfinding algorithm implementation
- Dynamic visualization of the robot's movement
- Customizable grid size and obstacles
- Interactive simulation for real-time pathfinding demonstration

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For graphical visualization of the algorithm.

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to the open-source community for their contributions and support.
- Inspiration taken from various resources on pathfinding algorithms and robotics.


## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
