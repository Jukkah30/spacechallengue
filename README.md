# A* Pathfinding Visualization

## Description
This project implements an A* search algorithm to find optimal paths in a simulated environment, featuring a graphical visualization of a robot's movement along its path. The algorithm is designed to navigate through a grid while avoiding obstacles, making it suitable for applications in robotics and automated exploration.

## Features
- A* pathfinding algorithm implementation
- Dynamic visualization of the robot's movement
- Customizable grid size and obstacles
- Interactive simulation for real-time pathfinding demonstration
